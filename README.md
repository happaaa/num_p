# longnum
Arbitrary precision arithmetic package for Dart

Work in progress. Most functions will be on the **testing** branch.


It supports:
-   Addition
-   Subtraction
-   Multiplication
-   Division
-   Modulo
-   Powers
-   Square root
-   Exponential function
-   Natural logarithm
-   Comparison operators (>, <=, ==, etc.)
-   Maximum and minimum
-   Absolute value
-   Trig functions


### Works in progress

-   Modulo function doesn't give correct answer with negative numbers


### Future improvements

-   Combine integer and decimal lists and add a radix variable instead
-   Make code much cleaner and concise to improve speed
